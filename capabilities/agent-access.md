# Agent Activation / Write-back

## What This Capability Means

Agent activation and write-back define how AI tools search, retrieve, cite, write, update, or maintain the second brain while doing work. Some systems also expose a first-party chat surface, which matters when users want to query the brain before wiring up an external agent.

## Evaluation Questions

- Is access available through MCP, API, SDK, CLI, plugins, or platform-only tools?
- Can AI tools write back?
- Is access scoped by user, source, project, or workspace?
- Can you verify the host AI tool actually used the memory surface?

## Scoring Guidance

Use this capability to decide whether the second brain is actually usable during AI-assisted work, not just whether storage is configured. A solution scores higher when an external AI tool can read and write memory through a documented surface, scope calls correctly, and show evidence that the host actually invoked the memory surface during work.

For the per-solution comparison, see [../comparisons/agent-access.md](../comparisons/agent-access.md).
